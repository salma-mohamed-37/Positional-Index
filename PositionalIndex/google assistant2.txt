Google Assistant, in the nature and manner of Google Now, can search the Internet, schedule events and alarms, adjust hardware settings on the user's device, and show
information from the user's Google account. Unlike Google Now, however, the Assistant can engage in a two-way conversation, using Google's natural language processing 
algorithm. Search results are presented in a card format that users can tap to open the page.
In February 2017, Google announced that users of Google Home would be able to shop entirely by voice for products through its Google Express shopping service, with 
products available from Whole Foods Market, Costco, Walgreens, PetSmart, and Bed Bath and Beyond at launch, and other retailers added in the following months as new 
partnerships were formed.
Google Assistant can maintain a shopping list; this was previously done within the notetaking service Google Keep, but the feature was moved to Google Express and the 
Google Home app in April 2017, resulting in a severe loss of functionality.
In May 2017, Google announced that the Assistant would support a keyboard for typed input and visual responses, support identifying objects and gather visual 
information through the device's camera, and support purchasing products and sending money.
