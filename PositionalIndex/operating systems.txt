An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.
Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass 
storage, printing, and other resources.
For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware, 
although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it.
Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers. 
There are many types of operating systems.
Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem. A multi-user operating system extends 
the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and resources, such as disk space, belonging to multiple users, and the system permits 
multiple users to interact with the system at the same time.  
A distributed operating system manages a group of distinct, networked computers and makes them appear to be a single computer, as all computations are distributed 
(divided among the constituent computers).
Embedded operating systems are designed to be used in embedded computer systems. They are designed to operate on small machines with less autonomy.
